        <p class="lead mb-4">Here is my story<br><br>

        My name is Camryn Katherine DeVos. I am currently attending the University of California Riverside as a third-year student. My first year of college I attended California State University of San Marcos, however, I saw a better fit for myself in attending University of California Riverside. Going into college I had always intended to graduate with a degree in Business, thus, when I started attending the University of California Riverside I started my path in majoring as a Business Economics major. Unfortunately, up until recently, I saw a better fit for myself if I majored in Political Science. After reviewing with my academic advisor, I decided to make the switch to this new major. As terrifying as this decision was, I made the leap and I am currently a Political Science major with a focus in International Affairs. Political Science aims to provide an understanding of basic political processes and institutions as these operate in different national and cultural contexts. And being a focus in International Affairs refer to events and activities that involve the governments, politics, economies, etc. of different countries. I am focused on graduating at this time and I should receive my Bachelor's degree by the end of next spring of 2026. After I graduate, I am interested in exploring the work fields, and possibly going for my Master's Degree.   <br><br>

        Something that is unique about me is that I am a registered Oral Surgeon Assistant. I have been working with an oral surgeon since I was 17 years old. I had to go through courses to gain knowledge in order to work in this industry. I had to take a Basic Life Support class, Oral Maxillofacial Surgery Assistant course, and more to start to work with patients. I was introduced to this field at a very young age, being that my mother is the office manager at this office. I was always the doctor‚Äôs ‚Äúlittle assistant‚Äù as I would always ask her if I can help her. We like to joke now that she has shaped me into her own personal assistant. Not only has this job formed me into the person I am today, but it has shown me the realities of working in a job atmosphere. It has showed me the good parts, as well as the harsh sides. I work will many different individuals every day, and they all come from different backgrounds and cultures. Being able to adapt to these people, and learn how to approach patients of mine has not only showed me how to be respectful, but also it has taught me how to be a personable employee with my patients. Not only am I their nurse, I want to approach them in a friendly matter to make them comfortable. That is the most important aspect in my opinion when working with others, it is to have an open and comfortable relationship. Although, I do have this as a career option, I do want to complete school and gain a degree in a different atmosphere so I have many options.
